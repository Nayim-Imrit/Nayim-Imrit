I'm a web developer enthusiast who is passionate about making open-source more accessible. Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, AngularJS, Ionic (mobile development), Node.js. I recently opted to work as an Robotic Process Automation Solution Architect <a href="https://stars.github.com/">GitHub Star ðŸŒŸ</a> based on my involvement in the tech industry.  My interests and my working environment help me diversify my learning scope.
