I'm a web developer enthusiast who is passionate about making open-source more accessible. Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, AngularJS, Ionic (mobile development), Node.js. I recently opted to work as an Robotic Process Automation Solution Architect ðŸŒŸ based on my involvement in the tech industry.  My interests and my working environment help me diversify my learning scope.
